Shortlisting the best candidates is hard. Although your resume is competitive, I had to choose amongst a lot of great candidates for the job: sorry! (Keep in mind that I can make mistakes :)) If it might help you for future applications, here is what recruiters like to see in resumes: Beautifully designed, Resume adapted to the job position (as it shows your motivation), i.e. : Catch phrase adapted to company, Highlight (or set bold) what matters for the job position, Key elements we need to qualify easily visible: your city, languages, phone, email, etc. No need to write a lot: 1 page is often better (imagine we have to check hundreds of resumes). Good luck finding your dream job.",
