Company_B,"Hello, Thank you for your interest in joining the [Company_B] team. We reviewed your application, and unfortunately, we decided not to proceed. Shortlisting the best candidates is hard. Although your resume is competitive, I had to choose amongst a lot of great candidates for the job: sorry! (Keep in mind that I can make mistakes :)) If it might help you for future applications, here is what recruiters like to see in resumes: Beautifully designed, Resume adapted to the job position (as it shows your motivation), i.e. : Catch phrase adapted to company, Highlight (or set bold) what matters for the job position, Key elements we need to qualify easily visible: your city, languages, phone, email, etc. No need to write a lot: 1 page is often better (imagine we have to check hundreds of resumes). Good luck finding your dream job.",0.9878,0.2846153846153846,28.0,0.1702462434768676,-0.7842265367507935,1.5416983316225883,SST-2 disagrees most
Company_J,"Hi [Name], First of all my apologies for not getting back sooner. As a person you have the values and personality that would fit with our organization. After several interviews, people finally agreed with me that your preference is a technical job to land in. However, this is not where your market value is. This is where you are competing with people with much stronger technical study and work experiences. So we've decided to not move forward with the recruitment process.
